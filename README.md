A simple Python console app using SQLite that lets users create, view, update, and delete form data easily.

This project is a simple Python SQLite CRUD application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete form data directly from the console. It stores user information such as name, email, and message in a local SQLite database (form_database.db). The program features a clean, menu-based interface for easy navigation and demonstrates basic database operations using Pythonâ€™s built-in sqlite3 module.
